## 🎨 About This Version

This version of **Renewed-Banking** features a **purely frontend overhaul** by **Prosir**.

> The entire backend system remains the original work by [**uShifty**](https://github.com/uShifty).  
> I (Prosir) focused exclusively on redesigning the **UI/UX**, moving to **TailwindCSS**, and cleaning up the overall visual experience.

This is not a backend rewrite or functional change — it's a UI modernization built on a great foundation.
